# Built-in Types

## Primitives

### Numbers, Strings and Booleans

Primitive types are the basic data unit in Wyrd. These are numbers `Num`, strings `Str`, booleans `Bool`.

```text
luckyNumber = 14
greetings   = "Hello world!"
isSexy      = True
```

```javascript
const luckyNumber = 14;
const greetings = 'Hello world!'
const isSexy = True
```

Notice that, Wyrd's **string must be surrounded by double-quotes**; on the other hand, Wyrd's **boolean must be either `True` or `False`**.

### Concept of "Empty" - Null

Special primitive type is `Null` which represents the concept of "empty".

```text
empty = Null
```

```javascript
const empty = null;
```

Differs from JavaScript, Wyrd's only use `Null` value to represent the concept of "empty", but do not introduce `undefined` value.

## List

### List Literal

`List` is a built-in type in Wyrd. It is represented as an **ordered** collection of data.

```text
fibSeries = [1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21]
```

```javascript
const fibSeries = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21];
```

Notice that `List` literal is declared surrounding with brackets `[ ]` and you **don't need commas to separate between different data**.

### Encourages Homogeneous Typed List

List often can be either homogeneous \(which means a list can contain single type of data\) or heterogeneous \(which means a list can contain multiple type of data\).

In Wyrd, it is a default behavior in which `List` literal will throw error if that list contains two or more data type.

```text
heterogeneous = [123 "Hello world" True Null]
```

```text
ParserError: Expect List to contain of type `Num`, instead mixed with type `Str`
```

Notice that the error message expects that the list is declared only contains the type `Num`. In other words, **the contained type of the list will be determined by the type of the first element**.
